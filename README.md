## From RF Data to Mono Audio

The main objective of this 3DY4 lab is to understand how to use signal-ï¬‚ow graphs to model a real-life radio application in software. The particular case study is concerned with processing RF data from an FM channel in order to produce mono audio. All the details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab3.pdf).

The start-up code is in the [model](model/) and [src](src/) sub-folders. Both the in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due one week plus one extra day after you have started the in-lab experiments. As an example, Tuesday groups who start the lab on Tuesday Feb 2 have this lab due by the end of the following Wednesday Feb 10; you can extrapolate the due date for the remaining lab groups.
